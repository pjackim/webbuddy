# GEMINI REQUIREMENTS


## VERY IMPORTANT: [READ **ALL** DOCUMENTATION]("../docs/")

> By default, use [shadcn-svelte components](../docs/shadcn-svelte/) for almost all UI elements.


Prioritize using components and logic described in the documentation. This will ensure consistency and maintainability across the project.

## CODE STANDARDS:
- Use Svelte 5 for all components.
- Follow the [Svelte 5 documentation](../docs/Svelte-5-Documentation.md) like a bible.
- All code must be Dry, Clean, Efficient, modular, and reusable.
- Ensure pretty human-readable logging (at least INFO and DEBUG).


## UI and UX:
- The UI should be intuitive and user-friendly. Do not reinvent the wheel, use the existing components and patterns as defined in the [documentation](../docs/shadcn-svelte/).
