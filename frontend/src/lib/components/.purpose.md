This folder will house your reusable Svelte components. With Svelte 5's introduction of snippets, you can create more flexible and composable components, reducing the need for complex slot-based layouts. The `ui` subfolder is ideal for base UI elements like buttons, inputs, and cards, which are often part of a design system.
