With Svelte 5 runes, the role of traditional Svelte stores has shifted from a general-purpose tool to a specialized one. While most shared reactive state can now be more simply managed by exporting runic values (e.g., `$state`) from `.svelte.ts` files, the `src/lib/stores` directory is not obsolete.

Instead of being phased out, this folder should be reserved for scenarios where the store contract provides distinct advantages. The plan is to refactor simple `writable` stores into runic state and retain this directory for advanced use cases, such as:

- **Complex Asynchronous Logic:** Managing state from sources like WebSockets or other complex data streams where the store's lifecycle methods are beneficial.
- **Custom Store Contracts:** Implementing stores with custom logic for setting and updating values.
- **Animation and Motion:** Utilizing Svelte's built-in motion stores like `tweened` and `spring`.
- **SvelteKit Integration:** Interacting with SvelteKit's APIs that provide data through stores, like those in `$app/stores`.
