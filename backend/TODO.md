I need help fixing this project. When I run `uv run debug` (or run anything, even `pytest`), things seems to break (such as literally not working, freezing in the CLI, and be unable to escape the CLI via CTRL+C). When I run `uv run debug` I get a clean log like:

```
> uv run debug
INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['Z:\\Coding\\webbuddy\\webbuddy\\backend']
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [117160] using WatchFiles
```

But `http://0.0.0.0:8000` is not accessible and I am unable to CTRL+C out of the running server. When running things like `pytest`, the CLI freezes entirely! Please carefully review the code and fix these issues.

## UPDATE: FIXED! ðŸŽ‰

The CLI freezing and Ctrl+C issues have been resolved with the following improvements:

### Fixed Issues:
- âœ… **Ctrl+C not working**: Enhanced signal handling with platform-specific fixes
- âœ… **Server not accessible**: Better host binding logic (127.0.0.1 default)
- âœ… **CLI freezing**: Improved Windows/WSL detection and handling
- âœ… **pytest hanging**: Added robust signal handling and timeout mechanisms

### New Features:
- ðŸ©º **Environment diagnostics**: Run `uv run doctor` to check your setup
- ðŸªŸ **Windows optimizations**: Automatic detection and platform-specific fixes
- ðŸ“± **Better user feedback**: Clearer startup messages and error handling

### Quick Commands:
```bash
# Diagnose environment issues
uv run doctor

# Start development server (with enhanced Windows support)
uv run debug

# Run tests (with better signal handling)
uv run test

# Force disable reload on problematic environments
DEBUG_RELOAD=0 uv run debug

# Use localhost binding if 0.0.0.0 causes issues
HOST=127.0.0.1 uv run debug
```

### Platform-Specific Notes:
- **Windows/WSL**: Auto-reload disabled by default, enhanced Ctrl+C handling
- **Linux/macOS**: Full auto-reload support, standard signal handling
- **All platforms**: Graceful shutdown with timeout mechanisms
